    """Run a structured quality self-check before delivering visual output to the user.

    You MUST call this tool BEFORE calling present_files for any visual output
    (chart, image, or presentation). This enforces a quality gate that ensures
    professional-grade deliverables.

    Workflow:
    1. Generate the visual output (chart/image/PPT)
    2. Call this tool with your honest self-assessment
    3. If issues_found is non-empty, fix them and regenerate BEFORE presenting
    4. Only call present_files after this tool returns "PASS"

    The checklist keys depend on output_type:

    For "chart":
    - data_integrity: Y-axis not truncated, data accurately represented
    - chart_type_fit: Chart type matches the data story
    - labels_complete: All axes labeled with units, title states the insight
    - color_accessible: Max 5 colors, color-blind safe, sufficient contrast
    - no_chartjunk: No 3D effects, unnecessary gridlines, or decorations

    For "ppt":
    - one_message_per_slide: Each slide has exactly one core idea
    - visual_consistency: All slides share the same style, colors, typography
    - storytelling_arc: Slides follow Hook → Context → Solution → Impact → CTA
    - text_hierarchy: Headlines 48-72pt, body 18-24pt, max 3 bullets per slide
    - negative_space: 40%+ whitespace on each slide

    For "image":
    - prompt_specificity: Prompt was 150+ words with concrete details
    - composition_balanced: Clear focal point, rule of thirds, appropriate framing
    - style_match: Output matches requested style and mood
    - color_harmony: Colors are harmonious and appropriate
    - no_artifacts: No blur, deformation, or quality issues

    Args:
        output_type: Type of visual output being checked (chart, ppt, image).
        description: Brief description of what was generated (e.g., "Q3 revenue bar chart" or "AI product launch keynote, 8 slides").
        checklist: Dict mapping check names to pass/fail booleans. All keys for the output_type must be present.
        issues_found: List of specific issues identified (e.g., "Y-axis starts at 50, should start at 0"). Empty list or None means no issues.
        action_taken: If issues were found and fixed, describe what was done (e.g., "Regenerated with Y-axis starting at 0").
